        > Individual section html, css files of Fruits & Vegetables are now archived/deleted.
        > HTML & CSS files of Fruits are now converted into index.html & style.css files respectively, thus creating one giant file (This will now be the Products page)
        > Home.html will now act as the Landing Page
        > navigation: text labeled pages instead of both text and icon pages

        Reasons:
        - Difficult to manage multiple files
        
        Plans:
        - Pages:
            Products
            Cart

        Future:
        - Pages:
            About Us/Contact
