        @index.html
        - Added favicon for the page

        Changes:
        - Commented profile/admin icon -> Future

    1.30 HRS:
        Changes:
        - Individual section html, css files of Fruits & Vegetables are now archived/deleted.
        - HTML & CSS files of Fruits are now converted into index.html & style.css files respectively, thus creating one giant file (This will now be the Products page)
        - Home.html will now act as the Landing Page
        - navigation: text labeled pages instead of both text and icon pages
        ^ Difficult to manage multiple files
