7 July 2025, Monday: (I kept working on the project for almost the whole day, so for exact timeframes, check the git-commits)
    @home.css & @home.html:
    # Files are now deleted (previously archived)

    @index.html:
    - Using Roboto as the font now. Added the code embeddings of the font as instructed, by (https://fonts.google.com/)
    - the hyperlink element based page logo "OmVaibhava Store" is now under h1 heading
    - deleted the "pages" div in the navigation-bar as it was unnecessary
    - instead the <ul> element now has the "pages" as its class
    - a new "About" added added as a <li> in pages
    - implemented draggable="false" for all images

    @styles.css:
    - Roboto implemented as the main font, sans-serif as the fallback font.
    - Improved animations when hovering over a page's text (like Products, About, etc):
        Now, When users hovers over the text, a underline & slightly dark-colored text smoothly appears.
    - When hovering over a shopping cart items count, a slightly dark-colored text background appears.
    - Attempted to crop the image & scale the images of a cart item, upon hovering. Later scrapped the idea as it was looking too complex.

    @script.js:
    - improved in-code comments for enhanced understanding.
    - implemented draggable="false" for all images.
    - localStorage implementation: to save items in shopping cart.

    @logs.txt:
    # Added explainations of for all the changes.

    10.00 HRS:
        Changes:
        - Commented profile/admin icon -> Future

    1.30 HRS:
        Changes:
        - Individual section html, css files of Fruits & Vegetables are now archived/deleted.
        - HTML & CSS files of Fruits are now converted into index.html & style.css files respectively, thus creating one giant file (This will now be the Products page)
        - Home.html will now act as the Landing Page
        - navigation: text labeled pages instead of both text and icon pages
        ^ Difficult to manage multiple files
